With a budget of $1.65 billion over five years, the act aims to enhance safety measures while also doubling civil penalties for violations, which now could reach $400,000 per day. 

For operators, this means implementing proactive risk mitigation strategies, especially in the wake of geohazards like landslides and earthquakes, which will require more frequent inspections of facilities. Furthermore, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is set to study the integration of hydrogen into natural gas systems, potentially leading to new regulations that could impact operational practices. 

This regulatory shift compels teams to evaluate and possibly modify their current safety procedures, documentation practices, and compliance strategies to align with the updated standards. The emphasis on modernizing pipeline safety regulations also includes specific guidelines for carbon dioxide pipelines, highlighting the need for ongoing adaptation in response to emerging risks.
